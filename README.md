## Fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation

This project focuses on fine-tuning the Alpaca model with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for a specific task. While the Alpaca model itself is heavyweight model, we used the Gemma model, a lightweight alternative from Kaggle, as a starting point for fine-tuning.

**Project Goals:**

* Adapt the Gemma model for a specific task using LoRA.
* Reduce the number of trainable parameters for efficient training.
* Achieve good performance on the target task with the fine-tuned model.

**Data Requirements:**

* Specify the dataset you will be using for fine-tuning. Ensure the data is pre-processed and formatted appropriately for the chosen task (e.g., question answering, text summarization).
* Split the data into training, validation, and test sets for model evaluation.

**Software Dependencies:**

* Python 3.x ([https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/))
* Transformers library ([https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index))
* TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the chosen implementation)
* Additional libraries based on specific needs (e.g., tokenization libraries)

**Fine-tuning Procedure:**

1. **Load the Gemma Model:** Utilize the `transformers` library to load the pre-trained Gemma model from Kaggle.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Apply necessary pre-processing steps to your dataset based on the target task. This might involve tokenization, formatting text pairs, and creating labels.
3. **LoRA Implementation:** Integrate LoRA functionality into the fine-tuning process. This involves defining the rank of the low-rank adaptation matrices and incorporating them into the model architecture.
4. **Model Training:** Define the training loop with appropriate loss function, optimizer, and training parameters. Train the fine-tuned model on your prepared dataset.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Monitor training progress using validation loss and metrics relevant to your task. Evaluate the final model performance on the held-out test set.

**Expected Outcomes:**

* A fine-tuned model with significantly reduced trainable parameters compared to the original Gemma model.
* Improved performance on the target task compared to the baseline Gemma model.
* Documentation and code to replicate the fine-tuning process.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Experiment with different LoRA hyperparameters (rank of adaptation matrices) to optimize performance.
* Explore techniques like early stopping and learning rate scheduling for efficient training.
* Consider integrating techniques like gradient clipping or mixed precision training if dealing with limited hardware resources.

**Next Steps:**

* Implement the fine-tuning pipeline with your chosen dataset and task.
* Experiment with different LoRA hyperparameters and training configurations.
* Evaluate the fine-tuned model's performance and compare it to the baseline.
* Refine the model and training process based on the obtained results.

This is a high-level overview of the project. Specific implementation details will vary depending on the chosen libraries, tasks, and desired functionalities.
